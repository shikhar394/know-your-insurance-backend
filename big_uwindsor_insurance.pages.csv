Page 33,"M Y B ENEFIT P LAN B OOKLET Co-ordination of Benefits (COB) If you are covered for extended health and dental benefits under more than one plan, your benefits under this plan will be coordinated with the other plan so that you may be reimbursed up to 100% of the eligible expense incurred. Claims must be submitted to the primary payor first. Any unpaid balances should then be submitted to the secondary plan(s). Use the following guidelines to identify the primary and secondary plans: GSC Plan Member This GSC student plan is always your primary plan. If you are the plan member under two group plans, priority goes in the following order: • The plan where you are a full-time plan member • The plan where you are a part-time plan member • The plan where you are a retiree Spouse If your spouse is a plan member under another benefit plan, this GSC coverage is always secondary. Your spouse must first submit claims to his/her benefit plan. Children When dependent children are covered under both your GSC plan and your spouse’s benefit plan, use the following order to determine where to submit the claims: • The plan of the parent whose birth date (month and day) occurs earliest in the calendar year • The plan of the parent whose first name begins with the earlier letter of the alphabet, if the parents have the same birth date • In cases of separation or divorce with multiple benefit plans for the children, the following order applies: - The benefit plan of the parent who has custody of the dependent child - The plan of the spouse of the parent who has custody of the dependent child - The plan of the parent who does not have custody of the dependent child - The plan of the spouse of the parent who does not have custody of the dependent child If the parents have joint custody and both have the children listed as dependents under their plans, claims should first be submitted to the plan of the parent whose birth date (month and day) occurs earliest in the calendar year. Balances can then be submitted to the other parent's plan. Travel Benefits In the event of a travel claim, all plans equally share the cost of the claim. When GSC is identified as a secondary carrier, submit the original Explanation of Benefits statement from the primary carrier and a copy of the claim form in order to receive any balances owing. g r e e n s h i e l d . c a 29",547
