Page 26,"LONG TERM DISABILITY (LTD) INCOME BENEFITS The plan provides you with regular income to replace income lost because of a lengthy disability due to disease or injury. Benefits begin after the waiting period is over and continue until you are no longer disabled as defined by the policy or you reach age 65, whichever comes first. Check the Benefit Summary for the benefit amount and waiting period. • If disability is not continuous, the days you are disabled can be accumulated to satisfy the waiting period as long as no interruption is longer than 2 weeks and the disabilities arise from the same disease or injury. If your employer provides short term disability or sick leave benefits that are still being paid when the waiting period ends, the waiting period will be extended until the end of the short term disability or sick leave benefit period, but not later than one year after your disability started. • LTD benefits are payable for the first 24 months following the waiting period if disease or injury prevents you from doing your own job. You are not considered disabled if you can perform a combination of duties that regularly took at least 60% of your time to complete. • After 24 months, LTD benefits will continue only if your disability prevents you from being gainfully employed in any job. Gainful employment is work you are medically able to perform, for which you have at least the minimum qualifications, and provides you with an income of at least 60% of your indexed monthly earnings before you became disabled. • After the waiting period, separate periods of disability arising from the same disease or injury are considered to be one period of disability unless they are separated by at least 6 months. 18",384
Page 27,"• Because you pay the entire cost of LTD coverage, benefits are not taxable. • Your LTD insurance will not continue past the end of the day before the date you reach age 65. Other Income Your LTD benefit is reduced by other income you are entitled to receive while you are disabled. Your benefit is first reduced by: • disability benefits you or another member of your family is entitled to on the basis of your disability under the Canada or Quebec Pension Plan that are paid directly to you, except for increases that take effect after the benefit period starts • retirement benefits under the Canada or Quebec Pension Plan, except for increases that take effect after the benefit period starts • benefits under any Workers' Compensation Act or similar law There is a further reduction of your LTD benefit if the total of the income listed below exceeds 85% of your monthly take-home pay before you became disabled. If it does, your benefit is reduced by the excess amount. • your income under this plan • loss of income benefits available through legislation, except for Employment Insurance benefits, which you and any other member of your family are entitled to on the basis of your disability, including automobile insurance benefits where permitted by law • disability benefits under a plan of insurance available through membership in an association 19",295
Page 28,"• employment income, disability benefits, or retirement benefits related to any employment except an approved rehabilitation plan or program (termination pay and severance benefits are included as employment income under this provision) Earnings received from an approved rehabilitation plan or program are not used to reduce your LTD benefit unless those earnings, together with your income from this plan and the other income listed above, including any increases in Canada or Quebec Pension Plan benefits that take effect after the benefit period starts, would exceed your indexed monthly take-home pay before you became disabled. If it does, your benefit is reduced by the excess amount. Vocational Rehabilitation Benefits Vocational rehabilitation involves a work-related activity or training strategy that is designed to help you return to gainful employment and a more productive lifestyle. A plan or program will be approved if it is appropriate for the expected duration of your disability and it facilitates your earliest possible return to work. Medical Coordination Benefits Medical coordination is a process of early involvement to ensure that you are diagnosed quickly and receive appropriate treatment on a timely basis. The goal is to enable you to return to work as early as possible and to prevent the disability from becoming long term or permanent. 20",265
Page 29,"Limitations No benefits are paid for: • Disability arising from a disease or injury for which you received medical care before your insurance started. This limitation does not apply if your disability starts after you have been continuously insured for 1 year, or you have not had medical care for the disease or injury for a continuous period of 90 days ending on or after the date your insurance took effect. • Any period in which you do not participate or cooperate in a prescribed plan of medical treatment appropriate for your condition. Depending on the severity of the condition, you may be required to be under the care of a specialist.

This does not apply to any portion of a period of maternity leave during which you are disabled due to pregnancy. • Any period after you fail to participate or cooperate in an approved rehabilitation plan or program. • Any period after you fail to participate or cooperate in a recommended medical coordination program. • Any 12-month period in which you do not live in Canada for at least 6 months. • Any period of confinement in a prison or similar institution. • Disability arising from war, insurrection, or voluntary participation in a riot. 21",309

Palliative care is treatment for the relief of pain in the final stages of a terminal condition. 23",293

For services and supplies, including a listing of the prior authorization drugs, go to www.canadalife.com . Prior authorization is intended to help ensure that a service or supply represents a reasonable treatment. If the use of a lower cost alternative service or supply represents reasonable treatment, Canada Life may require you or your dependant to provide medical evidence why the lower cost alternative service or supply cannot be used before coverage may be provided for the service or supply. Health Case Management Canada Life may contact you to participate in health case management. Health case management is a program recommended or approved by Canada Life that may include but is not limited to: • consultation with you or your dependant and the attending physician to gain understanding of the treatment plan recommended by the attending physician; • comparison with the attending physician, of the recommended treatment plan with alternatives, if any, that represent reasonable treatment; • identification to the attending physician of opportunities for education and support; and • monitoring your or your dependant’s adherence to the treatment plan recommended by the attending physician. In determining whether to implement health case management, Canada Life may assess such factors as the service or supply, the medical condition, and the existence of generally accepted medical guidelines for objectively measuring medical effectiveness of the treatment plan recommended by the attending physician. 35",328
Page 44,"Health Case Management Limitation Canada Life can, on such terms as it determines, limit the payment of benefits for a service or supply where: • Canada Life has implemented health case management and you or your dependant do not participate or cooperate; or • you or your dependant have not adhered to the treatment plan recommended by the attending physician with respect to the use of the service or supply.
